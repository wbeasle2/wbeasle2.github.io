                <h1>Origins of the web servers we use today</h1>
                <p>  
                    The origins of the internet begin earlier in the late 1960’s when the Russians launched their space satellite Sputnik, into space. The United States Department of Defense then commissioned a project to be able to communicate with other in case of a nuclear attack named ARPNET  (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) which would later become the backbone of the internet. This network of communication was very successful but was limited to universities and research entities that had contracts with the Department of Defense. It was not until the early eighties that a protocol allowing all networks to talk to each other became a standard and was released on January 1, 1983 “hence the birth of the Internet.” (Sharing Resources). 
                    With a common language that networks could talk to each other in place this lead a researcher at CERN to develop and invent the World Wide Web to better serve researchers at different facilities away from their homes around the world. This proposal was by Tims Berners-Lee thru his idea of “a "hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" in which a "web" of "hypertext documents" could be viewed by “browsers”. ( Berners-Lee, Tim). Tim wrote the code to browse the documents on his own and first Web Server. These Web Servers were developed on a Next Computer at CERN.  From building one of the first servers he also develop the client- server protocols named Hyper Transfer Protocol(HTTP) in 1989 -1991 which is the fundamental usage of the World Wide Web laying the groundwork of how information is shared and used today. 
                    Other forms of web servers were also being developed with one at the National Center for Super Computing Applications named NCSA HTTPd. This help bring another technology called Common Gateway Interface or CGI. When the user was making a request to the server it carried info about the user’s input information, the programs located on the server would take the input via CGI and then be given an output of response back when the program was finished. (Gundavaram) This enabled early forms of dynamic web content. As time progressed a new demand was made for a greater need of speed and ability to met the greater amount of users gaining access to the web. Patches were added to keep the server maintain but a later creation of Apache HTTP server from Apache Software Foundation arrived and gained rapid use and popularity in 1995. With its improvements from multiple contributors, surpassing NCSA HTTPd within a year of its release. Its open-source model, modular architecture, and cross-platform compatibility established it as the most widely used web server for much of the internet’s history (OpenLogic).
                    Many competitors emerged, each addressing shortcomings or providing solutions beyond what Apache offered. Microsoft launched Internet Information Services, which went alongside usage of its Windows server Platform, appealing to enterprise already committed to the suite of tools Microsoft provided at the time being. In the early 2000s, LiteSpeed entered the market, offering proprietary high-performance features while being compatible with Apache’s system. Another server technology, Nginx, first released in 2004 by Igor Sysoev, revolutionized web serving by adopting an event-driven, asynchronous architecture that handled concurrency more efficiently than the traditional thread-per-connection model used by Apache. From these developments an ecosystem of web servers was becoming more diversified, making it possible for organizations to select software based on their performance needs, infrastructure, and security requirements.
