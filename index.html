<h1>Discovering the history, status, and future directions of the usage of: Web Servers</h1>

<p>
    Web servers are a critical piece of technology that we rely on everyday having accessibility when needed in many fields of military, commerce, education, medical even entertainment. Today’s World Wide Web would not be the same without this human achievement of storing and sharing information thru the usage of web servers being constantly accessed daily from many devices ranging from phones, TVs, computers and even satellites. Items stored within the data banks of web servers can range from documents, videos, pictures and databases are processed based on request of multitude of users and machines alike. We will delve into a brief history of how this technology came to be and what currently these technologies are doing and what the future holds can help humanity make their lives better and productive.   
The origins of the internet begin earlier in the late 1960’s when the Russians launched their space satellite Sputnik, into space. The United States Department of Defense then commissioned a project to be able to communicate with other in case of a nuclear attack named ARPNET  (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) which would later become the backbone of the internet. This network of communication was very successful but was limited to universities and research entities that had contracts with the Department of Defense. It was not until the early eighties that a protocol allowing all networks to talk to each other became a standard and was released on January 1, 1983 “hence the birth of the Internet.” (Sharing Resources). 
With a common language that networks could talk to each other in place this lead a researcher at CERN to develop and invent the World Wide Web to better serve researchers at different facilities away from their homes around the world. This proposal was by Tims Berners-Lee thru his idea of “a "hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" in which a "web" of "hypertext documents" could be viewed by “browsers”. ( Berners-Lee, Tim). Tim wrote the code to browse the documents on his own and first Web Server. These Web Servers were developed on a Next Computer at CERN.  From building one of the first servers he also develop the client- server protocols named Hyper Transfer Protocol(HTTP) in 1989 -1991 which is the fundamental usage of the World Wide Web laying the groundwork of how information is shared and used today. 
Other forms of web servers were also being developed with one at the National Center for Super Computing Applications named NCSA HTTPd. This help bring another technology called Common Gateway Interface or CGI. When the user was making a request to the server it carried info about the user’s input information, the programs located on the server would take the input via CGI and then be given an output of response back when the program was finished. (Gundavaram) This enabled early forms of dynamic web content. As time progressed a new demand was made for a greater need of speed and ability to met the greater amount of users gaining access to the web. Patches were added to keep the server maintain but a later creation of Apache HTTP server from Apache Software Foundation arrived and gained rapid use and popularity in 1995. With its improvements from multiple contributors, surpassing NCSA HTTPd within a year of its release. Its open-source model, modular architecture, and cross-platform compatibility established it as the most widely used web server for much of the internet’s history (OpenLogic).
Many competitors emerged, each addressing shortcomings or providing solutions beyond what Apache offered. Microsoft launched Internet Information Services, which went alongside usage of its Windows server Platform, appealing to enterprise already committed to the suite of tools Microsoft provided at the time being. In the early 2000s, LiteSpeed entered the market, offering proprietary high-performance features while being compatible with Apache’s system. Another server technology, Nginx, first released in 2004 by Igor Sysoev, revolutionized web serving by adopting an event-driven, asynchronous architecture that handled concurrency more efficiently than the traditional thread-per-connection model used by Apache. From these developments an ecosystem of web servers was becoming more diversified, making it possible for organizations to select software based on their performance needs, infrastructure, and security requirements.
Web servers play multiple roles beyond serving static files such as HTML, CSS, and images. “The software by which the conversion of the high-level instructions is performed line-by-line to machine-level language, other than compiler and assembler, is known as interpreter”. (GeeksforGeeks) They also handle dynamic content by embedding interpreters or passing requests to application servers through interfaces like CGI or FastCGI. Resource management has become more advanced over time with allocating CPU, memory, network bandwidth and balancing usage of programs often to prevent service of denial webpages popping up. With older servers relied on creating a new process or thread for each connection, which proved inefficient under heavy loads. Modern servers such as Apache and Nginx manage thousands of concurrent connections with relatively low overhead. At the protocol level, web servers have had to keep pace with the evolution of HTTP. HTTP/1.1 standardized persistent connections, HTTP/2 introduced multiplexing and header compression, and HTTP/3, built on Google’s QUIC protocol over UDP, promises reduced latency, resilience to packet loss, and faster connection establishment (Trevisan et al.).
Security has a major role with business, personal computing, phones etc. and add on other another major function of web servers. The adoption of HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure has made encrypted communication the default standard, supported by modern servers through Transport Layer Security. Mozilla’s report on HTTPS adoption demonstrates how servers now universally enforce secure connections, provide automated certificate management, and support strong cryptographic protocols (Kerschbaumer et al.). Beyond encryption, web servers enforce access control, filter malicious requests, mitigate denial-of-service attacks, and generate logs for auditing and forensic analysis. Web servers also have the capability to reverse proxies servers, that act as intermediary of a client requests and load balancers which acts like a traffic manager for servers, distributing incoming traffic across back-end servers, caching frequently requested content of data or files in a temporary storage location to be called upon when needed, and compressing responses to improve efficiency. (MozDevNet)
Web Servers of all types can meet each usage of a business’s needs and have come a long way to be diverse in each usage. Apache remains a cornerstone of the open-source community and is widely deployed across industries for its reliability and configurability. Nginx has become a dominant choice for high-performance and high-concurrency scenarios, and it is often deployed as a reverse proxy or load balancer in front of other servers. LiteSpeed has carved out a niche in hosting environments, especially due to its speed and early support for new protocols such as HTTP/3. IIS continues to serve enterprises that rely on Microsoft’s ecosystem. Emerging solutions such as Caddy and serverless gateways represent a new wave of experimentation with automation and minimal configuration.
The adoption of HTTP/3 has been gradually increasing. Research by Perna, Trevisan, Giordano, and Drago indicates that HTTP/3 being driven by large infrastructure providers such as Google, Facebook, and Cloudflare. Their study shows that the performance benefits of HTTP/3 are especially evident in high-latency or mobile network environments, where the new transport layer reduces connection setup times. However, when websites load content from multiple third-party domains that do not support HTTP/3, performance gains are diluted (Perna et al.). Trevisan et al. also emphasize that, although HTTP/3 is promising, adoption remains partial, with many websites continuing to rely on HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. Cloudflare’s own measurements confirm this gradual uptake: its traffic share served over HTTP/3 increased significantly in 2022 and 2023, though HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 still remain widely in use (“Examining HTTP/3 Usage One Year On”).
Challenges for web servers remain significant. Backward compatibility with older clients, forcing servers to maintain support for multiple protocol versions simultaneously. Mixed content from external domains continues to limit the effectiveness of HTTP/3 in practice, since many third-party objects are not served over the newest protocols. Security risks also evolve as new protocols introduce fresh attack capabilities from outside sources wanted to break through defenses of others. One of the new protocols is QUIC 
Looking forward, the future of web servers will be shaped by several key trends. Wider adoption of HTTP/3 and QUIC(Quick UDP internet Connections) is expected as infrastructure matures while replacing the old TCP protocol with more third-party services support it. Research into prioritization frameworks, such as the EPS model proposed by Gupta and Bartos, promises to optimize user experience by intelligently scheduling resources in HTTP/3 (Gupta and Bartos). The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into web server operations is also beginning to emerge, with studies such as Gahtan. Showing how deep learning can be applied to infer server behavior and improve observability in encrypted QUIC traffic. At the architectural level, edge computing and serverless models like Caddy are shifting traditional server roles, with computation and content delivery moving closer to end users and away from centralized data centers. Energy efficiency is another pressing concern, as web servers will increasingly need to optimize for resource-constrained environments such as IoT and mobile devices.
In conclusion, web servers have transformed the world from education, commerce, medical and different field more than we can imagine. From simple client – server requests delivering static content to complex dynamic web pages, offering system capable software that underpin the modern web. Reflecting the collaboration power of open-source communities like Apache and others, the commercial innovation of enterprises, and the constant drive for better performance and security from within and out of the industry. Today’s web servers are more sophisticated manage security, contents of databases containing all the worlds knowledge. The next decade will bring even more profound changes as HTTP/3 adoption spreads, edge architectures evolve, and artificial intelligence becomes integrated into operations. Web servers usage has increased and evolved into what they are today from simple machine to leading industries enterprises into the future and what they can provide is limitless only by our own imagination.
